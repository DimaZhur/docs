To establish a WebSocket connection, you need a `wsToken`, which is returned by the `POST /v2/auth/token` method along with the `accessToken` and `refreshToken`.

A pair of `accessToken` and `refreshToken` will be sent to the [WebSocket](https://api.sandbox.altpay.uk/ws/client).

The client allows you to:

- Paste a token (from `POST v2/auth/token`)
- Establish a connection
- View incoming messages in real time
