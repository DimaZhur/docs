https://api.test.inside.altpay.uk/

This is the root address for all API endpoints. Whether you're fetching data, sending transactions, or checking integration status â€” everything begins here.

Make sure your system is pointing to this URL in all environments unless otherwise specified (e.g., sandbox or staging).

A friendly reminder: using the correct base URL will save you time, headaches, and make the integration process smoother. Sun will shine brighter, and your API calls will be happier.

If you have questions about environments or need access to test credentials, feel free to reach out to our team.
