title: Rate Limiting and 429 Response
---

Some API methods are protected with rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.
When too many requests are sent in a short period of time, the API will respond with:

`HTTP 429 Too Many Requests`

This means that the client has reached the allowed request limit for a given time window.
Further requests to the same endpoint should be delayed until the limit resets.

## Endpoints Affected by Rate Limiting

The following endpoints may return 429 Too Many Requests if called too frequently:

- `POST /v2/auth/refresh`

- `POST /v2/auth/token/refresh`

- `POST /v3/payment`

- `POST /v2/card/{id}/calculate/limits`

- `PATCH /v2/card/{id}/limits`

*Please note that: POST /v3/payment method allows to create around 10 payments in a second in case all the data is the same in request body. After reaching limit in 10 payments per second you may get 429 error code.
