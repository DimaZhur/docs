title: How can I create a card?
---

1. If you have no card wallet, it can be created with your first card. To order card together with card wallet execute `POST /v2/card` with no data in walletId parameter
2. If you already have a card wallet, execute `POST /v2/card` with id of the card wallet in walletId parameter
If you get the following response then card was created successfully

```json
{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "data": {
    "cardId": xxx
  }
}
```
