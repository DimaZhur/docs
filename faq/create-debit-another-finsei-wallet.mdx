Here are the steps:

1. Execute [`POST /v2/beneficiary`](/api-reference/endpoint/v2-beneficiary) with the following parameters in the request body, where:
   - `walletId`: UUID of the debit wallet
   - `targetWalletId`: UUID of your created second wallet

```json
{
 "status": "new", 
"walletId": 0, 
"amount": 0, 
"targetWalletId": 0, 
"reference": "string"					
}
```
