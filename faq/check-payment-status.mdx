## Status for payment

There are two statuses available for outgoing payment creation:  
<Badge variant="secondary">Draft</Badge> and <Badge variant="secondary">New</Badge>.

- <Badge variant="secondary">Draft</Badge> payments can be created for wallets with no balance. These can later be signed and processed, or may represent debit payments not yet signed by the client.  
- <Badge variant="secondary">New</Badge> status is for debit or credit payments that have been created but are not yet in process.
