## Status for payment

There are two statuses available for outgoing payment creation:  
**Draft** and **New**.

- **Draft** payments can be created for wallets with no balance. These can later be signed and processed, or may represent debit payments not yet signed by the client.  
- **New** status is for debit or credit payments that have been created but are not yet in process.

### Available statuses

**Draft**, **New**, **Compliance**, **Process**, **Completed**, **Canceled**, **Rejected**

### Typical flows

- **Draft** → **New** → **Compliance** → **Process** → **Completed**  
- **New** → **Canceled**  
- **Draft** → **New** → **Compliance** → **Rejected**

*Draft and Compliance statuses are optional*
