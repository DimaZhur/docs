### Outgoing Payment Statuses

There are two statuses available for outgoing payment creation: <Badge variant="secondary">draft</Badge> and <Badge variant="secondary">new</Badge>.

- <Badge variant="secondary">Draft</Badge> payments can be created for wallets with no balance. These can later be signed and processed, or they may represent debit payments not yet signed by the client.  
- <Badge variant="secondary">New</Badge> status is for debit or credit payments that have been created but are not yet in process.

#### Available statuses:
<Badge variant="secondary">Draft</Badge>{' '}
<Badge variant="blue">New</Badge>{' '}
<Badge variant="orange">Compliance</Badge>{' '}
<Badge variant="indigo">Process</Badge>{' '}
<Badge variant="green">Completed</Badge>{' '}
<Badge variant="default">Canceled</Badge>{' '}
<Badge variant="destructive">Rejected</Badge>

#### Typical status flows:
