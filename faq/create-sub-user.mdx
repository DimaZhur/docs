title: How can I create a sub-user?
---

1. Authorise as main user

2. Execute method [`POST /v2/member`](/api-reference/endpoint/v2-member) with filled-in fields

3. Copy `signId` value

4. Execute [`POST /v2/mfa/{type}/sign/{requestId}`](/api-reference/endpoint/verify-mfa) with parameters:
    - `type: sms`  
    - `requestId: signId` from step 3  
    - request body:
      ```json
      {
        "code": "111111"
      }
      ```
      > '111111' works only in sandbox. In production, use a library that generates TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)

5. Copy `signToken` value

6. Put `signToken` value into `signToken` field of [`POST /v2/member`](/api-reference/endpoint/v2-member) and execute method

7. If you receive a valid response â€” sub-user was created successfully

```json
{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "data": []
}
```
