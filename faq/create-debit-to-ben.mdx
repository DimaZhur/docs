title: How can I create a debit payment to the beneficiary?
---

1. If you have no beneficiary, execute 
[`POST /v2/beneficiary`](/api-reference/endpoint/post-v2-beneficiary) with all required data in request body

2. If you already have a beneficiary, execute 
[`POST /v3/peyment`](/api-reference/endpoint/post-v3-peyment) with the following parameters in the request body, where walletId: debit wallet id, beneficiaryId: id of created beneficiary.

```json
{
 "status": "new", 
"walletId": 0, 
"amount": 0, 
"beneficiaryId": 0, 
"reference": "string", 
"signToken": ""					
}
```
