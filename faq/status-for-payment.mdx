title: What is ‘status’ for payment?
---

There are two statuses available for outgoing payments creation: draft and new. Draft payments can be created for wallets with no balance and be signed and processed in future or it can be  debit payments that weren't signed by the client yet. Status new is for new debit or credit payments that are not in process yet.
