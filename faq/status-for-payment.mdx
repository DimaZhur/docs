## Outgoing Payment Statuses

There are two statuses available for creating outgoing payments: `draft` and `new`.

- **Draft**  
  Used when:
  - The wallet has no balance.
  - It’s a debit payment not yet signed by the client.
  - Can be signed and processed later.

- **New**  
  Indicates a new debit or credit payment that hasn't been processed yet.
