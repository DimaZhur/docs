A card can be ordered either for an existing wallet or for a new one â€” in this case, the wallet will be created along with the card order.

Cards can be of three types:

- Physical

- Virtual multi-use (activated automatically)

- Virtual single-use (activated automatically)

Users can order an unlimited number of physical and virtual multi-use cards.

Only one virtual single-use card is allowed at a time, as long as it has an active or blocked status.
