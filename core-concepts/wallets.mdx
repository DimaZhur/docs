## `isFavourite` Flag

The `isFavourite` flag allows users to mark wallets as favorites. These wallets are then displayed in a separate **Favourite** section.

You can update the `isFavourite` flag for any wallet, regardless of the user's role.  
The flag can be changed using the `PATCH /v2/wallet/{id}` method.
