Crucial attributes of a beneficiary are: currency, IBAN and template name.

The combination of **currency + IBAN** must be unique. You cannot create a beneficiary with the same IBAN and currency as an existing one - such attempts will be rejected.

Based on the currency you chose during beneficiary creation, additional fields can become required to fill in.
