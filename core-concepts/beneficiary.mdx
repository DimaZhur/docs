title: Beneficiary
description: "Beneficiary is an entity that holds IBAN in it and can be used to create debit payments."
---


Company beneficiaries can be created via POST /v2/beneficiary and viewed via GET /v1/beneficiary or GET /v1/beneficiary/{id} methods in API.

Depending on the recipient you want to pay to, beneficiaries can be of two types: **Individual** and **Company**.


Crucial attributes while creating beneficiary are: currency, IBAN and entity_type.

The combination of **Currency + IBAN** must be unique. You cannot create a beneficiary with the same IBAN and currency as an existing one - such attempts will be rejected.

Based on the currency you chose during beneficiary creation, additional fields can become required to fill in.


After creating a beneficiary, the following actions are available:

- **Send (pay)**
- **Delete**
- **Edit template name**
