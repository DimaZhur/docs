### How can I create a sub-user?

1. Authorise as main user  
2. Execute `POST /v2/member` method with filled-in fields  
3. Copy `signId` value  
4. Execute `POST /v2/mfa/{type}/sign/{requestId}` with:
    - `type`: `sms`  
    - `requestId`: `signId` from step 3  
    - request body:
      ```json
      {
        "code": "111111"
      }
      ```
      > `111111` is valid only for sandbox. In production, it should be generated by a TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) library.
5. Copy `signToken` value  
6. Put `signToken` value into `signToken` field of `POST /v2/member` method  
7. Execute `POST /v2/member` method again  
8. If you receive a valid response â€” sub-user was created successfully
