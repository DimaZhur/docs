title: How can I create a card?
---

1. If you have no card wallet, it can be created with your first card. To order card together with card wallet execute [`POST /v2/card`](/api-reference/endpoint/post-v2-card) with no data in walletId parameter
2. If you already have a card wallet, execute [`POST /v2/card`](/api-reference/endpoint/post-v2-card) with id of the card wallet in walletId parameter

If you get the following response then card was created successfully:

```json
{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "data": {
    "cardId": "xxx"
  }
}
```
⚠️ Please be aware that there may be a propagation delay between the initial creation of a card and its final activation. A card is not immediately ready for transactions the moment the creation request is successful.

To ensure that a card is fully activated and ready for use, you should not rely on polling. Instead, we recommend implementing a webhook listener. You must [subscribe](/getting-started/payment-webhooks) to the [v1.card.update](/getting-started/payment-webhooks#v1-card-update) event and wait for a notification containing the appropriate card status (e.g., ACTIVE).

Processing should only continue once your system receives this specific event, confirming that the card has been successfully provisioned in the banking core.
