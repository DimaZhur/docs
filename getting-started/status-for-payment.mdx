title: What is ‘status’ for payment?
---

There are two statuses available for outgoing payments creation: draft and new. 

Draft payments can be created for wallets with no balance and be signed and processed in future or it can be  debit payments that weren't signed by the client yet. 

Status new is for new debit or credit payments that are not in process yet.

There are statuses of outgoing payments you can see:
- `Draft`
- `New`
- `Compliance`
- `Process`
- `Completed`
- `Canceled`
- `Rejected`

The most typical flows of status change for outgoing payments are the following:

  <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#fbd38d', padding: '2px 6px', borderRadius: '4px' }}>Compliance</span> →
  <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#bee3f8', padding: '2px 6px', borderRadius: '4px' }}>Process</span> →
  <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#9ae6b4', padding: '2px 6px', borderRadius: '4px' }}>Completed</span>

- <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#90cdf4', padding: '2px 6px', borderRadius: '4px' }}>New</span> →
  <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#fbd38d', padding: '2px 6px', borderRadius: '4px' }}>Canceled</span>

- <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#ccc', padding: '2px 6px', borderRadius: '4px' }}>Draft</span> →
  <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#90cdf4', padding: '2px 6px', borderRadius: '4px' }}>New</span> →
  <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#fbd38d', padding: '2px 6px', borderRadius: '4px' }}>Compliance</span> →
  <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#feb2b2', padding: '2px 6px', borderRadius: '4px' }}>Rejected</span>

The 'Draft' and 'Compliance' statuses are optional.
A payment in 'Draft' status is a preliminary record that is not yet ready for execution. It serves as a placeholder or template for the intended payment. To progress the payment through the system, it must be signed using the POST /v3/payment/sign method. Only after successful signing will the payment transition to the next stage of the processing lifecycle.

Status 'Cancelled' is final and can be performed by the user via the POST /v1/payment/id/cancel method. Only payments in status 'New' can be cancelled.

'Completed' and 'Rejected' statuses are final.

>*Please note that if you have not received any of the final statuses mentioned above, you cannot position the payment as executed. In case you get an error or any response that doesn't allow you to identify the payment as executed, please contact support.*
