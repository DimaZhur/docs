Here are the steps:

1. Execute [`POST /v3/payment`](/api-reference/endpoint/post-v3-payment) with the following parameters in the request body, where:
   - `walletId`: UUID of the debit wallet
   - `targetWalletId`: UUID of the credit wallet

```json
{
 "status": "new", 
"walletId": 0, 
"amount": 0, 
"targetWalletId": 0, 
"reference": "string"					
}
```
